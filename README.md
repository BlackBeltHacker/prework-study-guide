# Prework Study Guide Webpage
## A study guide for course pre-work.

- I did this project as part of my Front End Development Bootcamp with Department for Education

- This Prework Study Guide was created for boot camp students who were going through the Prework. It contains notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.

- I built this project to display that I understand JavaScript and HTML and CSS and Git as Bootcamp preparation.

- It lets the Bootcamp from DfE know that I can use these technologies and that I will be able to learn on the course quickly and adequately and that I can follow and study in my own time as a self starting self learner of coding.

- I already know JS, HTML, CSS, and Git but I did actually learn some things about Git and Github that I had not learned before for example rebasing and merging branches and dealing with Issues etc.

## Installation
N/A
Installation is not required as it is a website using HTML, CSS, and JS. 

## Usage
- Download the code into a folder and open the index.html in a browser or live server extension in VS Code.

- To use this Prework Study Guide, you can review the notes in each section. For suggestions on what to study first, open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. There you will see a list of topics we learned from the prework along with a suggestion on which topic to study first.
